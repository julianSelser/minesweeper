##Important
- pass bombs as parameter to Grid

##Would be nice
- maybe make a 1x1 game invalid so as to avoid ugly checks
- game state is ugly, a move shouldnt be possible when game is finished
- grid calculates cells to show every time its asked, not efficient
- maybe Hidden and Marked cell elements shouldnt be in the Elements hierarchy

##To make it "cheto"
- maybe make a React frontend
